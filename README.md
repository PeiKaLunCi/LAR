Latent Autoregression
============
This repo extends ForneyLab.jl by introducing AR node that implements Variational Message Passing (mean-field and structured) for inferring AR coefficients, noise variance and hidden states of AR process.

Getting started
===============
There are [demos](https://github.com/biaslab/LAR/tree/master/src/demo) available to get you started.

How to connect AR-node to ForneyLab
===============
```julia
] dev "https://github.com/biaslab/LAR.git"
```
